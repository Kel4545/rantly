        at large, without having to worry about my thoughts. I just type it out,
        hit click, and feel the surge of relief. Thanks Rantly, you've truly made my
        most insane rants heard. I remember a time when I wasn't able to truly express
        myself. It's really frustrating when you want to be heard and no one..."
